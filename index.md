# HBP - What's next?

We're at another hiatus. Looks like we have to shift gears a bit.

This document will help guide you with our current stand-off point with Hi and Bye Productions and what you'll possibly need in order to continue from where we left off.

## Marketing

We've been somewhat low-profile with our social media but as you may already know, we've been lightly active with Instagram, posting several of our past projects in hopes to revive them and remind our fans of our past works.

### Instagram

Now that Instagram has given us the option to upload edited videos, we can definitely take advantage of that creating trailers, teasers, or even promo videos for upcoming projects.

### Facebook

Our fan page is a great place to reach our fans and smack some content right on their Facebook feed. Doing so will also give us some insight and analytics with who is viewing our content and how they react to it.

### Film Festivals, Contests and other Film Opportunities

As a film crew, our best go-to option for getting us out there is getting ourselves involed in these film opportunities. Constantly be on the look out and be aware of these local film events. *For example, WTFilm Festival&mdash;We definitely took advantage of this pwning all n00bz.*

## Projects

Our brand is and should remain known for our consistent work and how we display it.

### Music Videos

Stay away from performance-only music videos, unless its a money opportunity for us.

When writing for a short film music video, I like to refer back to **Erick Steiner**, letting us know that we've *nailed* the Romance genre. We didn't actually *nail* the Romance genre, but if we continually write these Romance or Love stories, we'll definitely get better, perfect it, and maybe even come up with a *formula* that will make our stories *work* all the time.

### Short Films

Read what I have above for the Romance and Love genre.

We may definitely explore different genres, but we should definitely keep it safe and stay with what we're good at. Those are **Romance/Love** and **Comedy**.

### Hi and Bye Projects

#### BTSBS

When it is *hiatus season*, that only means one thing&mdash;BTSBS time! *Behind The Scenes Bull Sh#t* is comedic series that both showcases the "how to" of our film projects and our exaggerated humor through our fictional characters.

#### Actual BTS

Behind The Scenes footage is definitely very useful and intersting if we plan on having a second camera and operator doing that specific job.

## Strategy

### #TrendChart

This #TrendChart should display categories and time (past, current, and future). I believe, with the help of Mike, you guys can compile something very clever that can help with various projects in the future.

I imagine the following functions for the #TrendChart:

- Past trends (not all, but some that still remain "alive")
- Current trends
- Where it came from
- When it started trending
- A prediction and estimate of when it will fade out

The cateogires that we should keep track of are:

- **Holidays** or National Holidays: Backup Day, Pancake Day
 - Some good references from [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/get-free-stuff-all-year-long-with-this-master-list-of-f-1451422547) and [Google Calendar](http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=lifehacker.com_n98psf3du9ckkdun4hbhm4abbo%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York%20)
- **Sports**
- **Local News:** New food spots, local shootings, Bay Bridge
- **World News:** Anything that would give insight to one who doesn't watch world news at all
- **Technology:** Apple, Gadgets, etc...
- **Internet:** Apps (Tinder), Websites, YouTube Videos
- **Social Media:** Instagram trends, new hashtags
- **Music**: Albums, New Artists. Ask me I'll know all about this
- **Movies**: Hunger Games, etc.
- **TV Shows**: Walking Dead, etc.
- **Celebrity Gossip**

## Scheduling

The best thing to do when scheduling paid projects is to make sure the project is **two weeks in advance**. The soonest someone can book us for something would probably be **one week in advance.**

When it comes to our side HBP projects like *BTSBS* or *meetings*, just let all of us know **at least 1 or 2 days in advanced.**

## Pricing

Keep in mind that our rate would be **$20/man hour.**

### What is a "Man Hour?"

If we book a one man project and he works on everything from production to post by himself with a total of 8 hours, the total would be $160.

> `8 (hours) x 20 (dollars) = $160`

If we have a typical music video with two locations, performance only (no story), we average these type of videos to take 1.5 hours per location tops. We usually would have at least 2 men working on the production. Editing is usually twice or 2.5x the length of the shoot. The total for this project would estimate to be $240.

> `3 (hours: production) x 2 (men during shoot) = 6`
>
> `6 (hours: post-production) x 1 (man editing) = 6`
>
> `12 (hours: total man hours) x 20 (dollars) = $240`

## Conclusion

Hit me or Deguzman up for questions.

Good luck.
