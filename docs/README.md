WikiStyleMD
===========

Wanted to create a document that was very legible and straightforward, just like Wikipedia's documents. Markdown was the option and styling it just like Wikipedia is just what I did.

This is still a work in progress. Styles aren't 100% complete as of yet.

Usage
-----

If you have .md files in the same directory, all you must do is set the ``f`` parameter equal to that file name

     http://your.com/?f=README

If README.md is in the same directory, a pretty HTML WikiStyleMD version will be generated server side.
